                            <p>Setting goals allows you to apply focus and direction to the course of your day. And you may find you’re more productive, too. Why are goals important? Simply put, they allow you to focus your attention on an objective and measure your progress along the way.

                                "In many ways, we already know the importance of goal setting — most everyone’s got a “bucket list” of some sort — so, why not put pen to paper and identify exactly what you want to accomplish with your life?" (amfam.com)  </p>
                                <p>https://www.amfam.com/resources/articles/support-for-your-dream/why-goal-setting-is-important</p>
							<p>"We all know that setting goals is important, but we often don’t realize how important they are as we continue to move through life. Goal setting does not have to be boring. There are many benefits and advantages to having a set of goals to work towards.
                                Setting goals helps trigger new behaviors, helps guides your focus and helps you sustain that momentum in life.
                                Goals also help align your focus and promote a sense of self-mastery. In the end, you can’t manage what you don’t measure and you can’t improve upon something that you don’t properly manage. Setting goals can help you do all of that and more" (PositivePsychology.com).</p>

							<p>“Feeling good, positive emotions do good things for our brains and bodies. They lower stress hormones, help ease anxiety and depression, and improve our immune system. Feeling some positive emotions every day has a big effect on our happiness and well-being. That's why it's so important to do things that give us positive feelings. Even simple actions like playing with a child or a pet or going for a walk outdoors can inspire these feelings”(KidsHealth.org).</p>
